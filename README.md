PokemonWebApp is a web application for browsing and interacting with Pokémon data.
The idea is to allow users to explore Pokémon, view details, and possibly manage favorites or other Pokémon-related operations.

Features

Here are some possible key features (modify according to what you have implemented):

User registration and authentication

Listing Pokémon

Viewing detailed info about each Pokémon (stats, images, types, etc.)

Search and filter by name, type, or other attributes

Ability to mark favorites (or similar user-specific actions)

Admin or management interface (if applicable)

API integration or external data fetching from Pokémon APIs

Technologies & Architecture

Based on the project structure in the repo:

Controllers, Data, Models, DTOs, Repository pattern present

Migrations folder suggests use of Entity Framework or another ORM

Seed.cs indicates seeding initial data

Configuration files (appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json)

Custom API key scheme (likely for securing endpoints)

The project uses C# / .NET as core language / platform 
GitHub

Typical architectural layers:

Controllers — handle HTTP requests

Data / Repository — data access and persistence

Models / DTOs — domain models and data transfer objects

Helpers / Interfaces — utility functions and abstractions

Migrations / Seed — database schema and initial data

Installation / Setup

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Brskstdnv/PokemonWebApp.git


Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code.

Configure the connection strings and API keys in appsettings.json / appsettings.Development.json.

Apply migrations to set up the database:

dotnet ef database update


(Optional) Seed initial data if required (through Seed.cs or a similar mechanism).

Run the application.

Usage

Use user accounts to interact with Pokémon data (explore, favorite, etc.).

Browse Pokémon list, navigate to detail pages.

Use search and filter functionality to narrow down results.

Admin / privileged users can manage dataset or internal records (if applicable).
